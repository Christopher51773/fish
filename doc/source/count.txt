count
*****

Counts the number of objects matching a set of conditions

**FORM**
::

    fdb count [flags] <object specifier>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    $ fdb count -q 'has njr/rating'
    141 objects matched
    Total: 141 objects

    $ fdb count -a 'Eiffel Tower'
    Total: 1 object

    $ fdb count -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"'
    6 objects matched
    Total: 6 objects

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.
::

  $ fdb untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating  
  Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
  Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTES**

The Fluidinfo API does not provide a primitive ``count`` function,
so FDB actually has to retrieve all the objects that match the query
and count them; this operation can, therefore, be comparatively slow.

The user's ability to read tags is regulated by the permissions system,
so the count reflects that, i.e. it is the restricted to objects
that the user can see the relevant tags for.
