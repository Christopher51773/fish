Shell-Fish: The Online version of Fish
--------------------------------------

There is a version of ``fish`` available online at
http://shell-fish.appspot.com.

This version provides full access to the whole of ``fish`` with very few
exceptions and changes.

Key things to know are:

  * You can log into Shell-Fish, the on-line version, with any Google account.
    (Shell-Fish does not see your Google password.)
    If you do this, you can go into Settings and store one or more sets of
    Fluidinfo credentials; thereafter, when you are logged in through your
    Google account, you will be able to interact with Fluidinfo using those
    credentials.   (The ``su`` command will switch between users.)   You can
    also specify whether you wish to use full Fluidinfo-style paths or
    abbreviated Unix-style paths with fish online.

  * If you don't log in, you will be able to interact with Fluidinfo
    using the ``fish``.   This user has restricted permissions, meaning
    that you can perform any normal read operations, and can tag things
    with tags ``fish/a`` through ``fish/z``, but not create new tags
    or namespaces, or delete tags.

  * When interacting with Shell-Fish, you use exactly commands as at
    the command line except that you may omit the ``fish``, i.e you
    can use
    ::

        ls

    instead of
    ::

        fish ls

    etc.

  * This help is available using the Help link at the top of the Shell-Fish
    page.

  * There is a bookmarklet called ``az-fish`` towards top right of the screen.
    If you drag this to your browser's tool bar and the then click on it
    when you are on an Amazon UK or Amazon US product page for a book,
    e-book, CD or MP3 track, it will take you into Shell-Fish and attempt
    to conrstruct the appropriate about tag for that item using the
    ``amazon`` command anf the ``abouttag`` library.

  * The ``Shell-Fish`` service runs on Google's App Engine, which has
    limits on how long HTTP calls can take.   The practical result of this
    is that complex ``fish`` commands may time out; for example,
    running the tests would be ill-advised.
    Timeouts will obviously be more common at times when Fluidinfo is
    under particularly heavy load.
