.. _fishlistseq:

listseq â€” lists items in or searches a sequence
***********************************************

Lists the items in a sequence, or searches a sequence for matching
items.

Note, this command is normally used through an alias, which is usually
the plural form of the items in the sequence.

**FORM**
::

  listseq tag
  listseq tag n
  listseq tag search terms

With just a tag, this shows the items in the sequence.

With a number, it shows the last n items in the sequence.

If any other parameters are given, these are taken as search terms; all
must be present to match.

**EXAMPLE**

Assume that a sequence has been created like this:
::

    $ mkseq remark remarks private/remark
    Next remark number: 0

    $ fish mkseq remark remarks private/remark
    Next remark number: 0
    zero:$ fish remark "Isn't this a remarkable first remark"
    0: Isn't this a remarkable first remark
    2011-12-18

    $ fish remark "...and this only slightly less remarkable"
    1: ...and this only slightly less remarkable
    2011-12-18

    $ fish remark "Too REMARKABLE"
    2: Too REMARKABLE
    2011-12-18

Then ``remarks`` is an alias
::

    $ fish alias remarks
    remarks:
      njr/.fish/alias = "listseq /njr/private/remark"

so we can say
::

    $ fish remarks
    0: Isn't this a remarkable first remark
    2011-12-18

    1: ...and this only slightly less remarkable
    2011-12-18

    2: Too REMARKABLE
    2011-12-18

or equivalently
::

    $ fish listseq private/remark

which produces the same output.

We can limit the output to remarks containing ``remarkable``:
::

   $ fish remarks remarkable
   0: Isn't this a remarkable first remark
   2011-12-18

   1: ...and this only slightly less remarkable
   2011-12-18

Or to the most recent remark:
::

   $ fish remarks 1 
   2: Too REMARKABLE
   2011-12-18
