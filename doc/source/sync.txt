sync â€” synchronizes the Fish cache with Fluidinfo
*************************************************

The Fish cache is a local copy of aliases and related configuration
information to avoid having to read this from Fish before interpreting
every command.   The cache is normally refreshed whenever an interactive
Fish session is started (by typing ``fish`` with no parameters), but can
also be forced to update with the sync command.

Although the command is called ``sync``, in reality the cache is simply
overwritten with data from Fluidinfo, which is considered to be the master
copy.   (Changes to aliases are automatically written to Fluidinfo, so no
true synchronization should be necessary.)
