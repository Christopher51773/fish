get â€” gets the values (only) of tags on objects
***********************************************

Gets the values of the tags nominated from the objects specified
and reports them in a short form,

**FORM**
::

    [fish] get [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as  user ``alice``:
::

    $ fish get -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen /bert/seen
      7
      alice/seen
      (tag bert/seen not present)

Alternative specifications:
::

    get -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen /bert/seen
    get -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 rating seen /bert/seen
    get -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' rating seen /bert/seen
    get -F -a "Eiffel Tower" alice/rating alice/seen bert/seen

All of these commands will show the values the tags ``alice/rating``,
``alice/seen`` and ``bert/seen`` from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``;
The last one may also show other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.


**NOTES**

The ``-F`` option specifies "Fluidinfo-style" full paths; when this option
is used, all tag names are assumed be absolute, i.e. must start with
the username.

The user's ability to read tags is regulated by the permissions system.
