rm â€” removes tags and namespaces
********************************

The ``rm`` command is used to remove (delete) tags and namespaces.
Namespaces normally have to be empty for this to work (unless
the ``-r`` options is specified) and tags have to be unused
(unless the ``-f`` option is used).

**FORM**
::

    [fish] rm [flags] [<namespace>|<tag>]

**FLAGS**

  * ``-r`` recurse (remove all tags and subnamespaces)
  * ``-f`` force (currently, don't complain if it doesn't exist or if
    in the case of a tag, the tag is in use.   In future, this will
    also override permissions if necessary, where possible.)


**EXAMPLES**

  #. Remove an unused tag ``njr/unused``:
     ::

        $ rm njr/unused

  #. Remove a used tag ``njr/used``, in the process removing that tag
     from all objects to which it is attached:
     ::

	$ rm -f njr/used

  #. Remove an empty namespace ``njr/empty``:
     ::

        $ rm njr/empty

  #. Remove a non-empty namespace ``njr/inUse`` and all the tags and
     namespaces under it:
     ::

        $ rm -r njr/inUse

**NOTES**

``-R`` may also be used for recurse.   (``-R`` and ``-r`` are interchangeable
on all commands in ``fish``.)

Strictly, following Unix's lead, you shouldn't have to force ``rm`` to
remove a tag that is in use, just as you can remove empty files
without a ``force`` option in Unix.  However, since a tag may be
attached to millions of objects, it seems prudent to insist.  The
flag ``-r`` can also be used to force the removal of a non-empty tag since
there is also a sense in which this is a recursive remove.

The ``fish rm`` command effectively takes the place of ``rmdir`` from Unix,
as well as ``rm``.

There is no ``unrm`` command: once it's gone, it's gone.
Use the ``-r`` and ``-f`` flags carefully.
