  * Fluidinfo always uses full tag paths, i.e. to use her ``rating``
    tag, Jacqui always has to call it ``jacqui/rating``.
    ``fdb`` allows jacqui to refer to it simply as ``rating``.
    If she needs to refer to someone else's tag, she simply puts
    a slash in front of the full path.   So for Jacqui, in ``fdb``,
    ``rating`` refers to her rating tag, but ``/njr/rating`` refers
    to mine.

    Some user's don't like this facility; ``fdb`` has both a
    configuration option (``unix-style-paths false``)
    and a command-line flag (``-F``) to make the fdb command line
    accept only full Fluidinfo-style paths.

  * The Fluidinfo root user, ``fluiddb`` maintains a tag generally
    referred to as *the* about tag; its full path is ``fluiddb/about``.
    This tag is special in that, if it is set, it uniquely and
    permanently identifies an object; in this sense, it can be used
    as an alternative to the object ID in many cases.
    No two objects ever share an about tag.
    When choosing where to place information in Fluidinfo,
    the about tag is the usual way of deciding.

    Recognizing the special place the the *about* tag has,
    ``fdb`` allows users to refer to it as ``/about`` rather
    than ``fluiddb/about``.   Again, this facility is removed
    if the user chooses not to use unix-style paths.
