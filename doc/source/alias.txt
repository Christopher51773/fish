alias â€” create or show Fish aliases
***********************************

Alias is used to create Fish aliases, i.e. new commands for fish.
The aliases are stored both in Fluidinfo and in the local file
system in a cache.   The cache is refreshed by using Fish's ``sync``
command or by starting Fish interactively.   This allows aliases
to be shared across machines.

**FORM**
::

   alias
   alias alias-name
   alias alias-name fish-commands

With no parameters, alias lists all aliases in use.

With a single parameter, ``alias`` lists the expansion for the alias
given, if it exists.

With two or more parameters, the alias is defined (or redefined).

Any parameters passed to the alias are simply added to the expanded command.
So, for example, if we say
::

   fish alias paris 'show -a "Paris"'

then this creates an alias ``paris`` that can be used as follows:
::

   $ fish paris rating
   Object with about="Paris":
     /njr/rating = 10
