mkns â€” makes a new namespace
****************************

The ``mkns`` command may be used to create a namespace, and optionally
to set its description.
The command ``mkdir`` may be used as an alternative.

**FORMS**
::

    mkns path
    mkdir path

**FLAGS**

  * ``-m description`` Sets the description (metadata) for a tag.


**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as the user ``alice``:

  #. Create a namespace called ``alice/secret``
     ::

        $ touch secret

  #. Create a tag ``alice/very/secret`` with description "keep right out"
     ::

	$ touch -m "keep right out"  very/secret

**NOTE**

Namespace Tag creation is automatic on first use in ``fish``.  This
command is only needed, therefore, if you wish to set permissions
before use set permissions before use or specify a description.

The ``mkns`` command cannot be used (at present) to change the
description of an existing namespace.
