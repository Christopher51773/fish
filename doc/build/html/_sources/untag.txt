untag â€” removes tags from objects
*********************************

Removes one or more tags from the object or objects specified.

**FORM**
::

    [fish] untag [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as  user ``alice``:
::

    untag -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen
    untag -a "Eiffel Tower" /alice/rating seen
    untag -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 rating seen
    untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" alice/rating alice/seen
    untag -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' rating seen

**NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS**
Working from a Windows command line, single quotes
do not work as above.   Instead you need to use double quotes and "stutter"
quotes inside quotes.   So the last example becomes:
::

    untag -q "fluiddb/about matches """Eiffel Tower""" rating seen

All of these commands will remove the tags ``alice/rating``
and ``alice/seen`` from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``;
The last one may also tag other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.

The ``-F`` option specifies "Fluidinfo-style" full paths; when this option
is used, all tag names are assumed be absolute, i.e. must start with
the username.

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.
::

    $ fish untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" bert/rating  
    Failed to remove tag bert/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
    Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTE**

The user's ability to remove tags from objects is governed by
the permissions system.
