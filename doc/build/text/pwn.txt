pwn
***

For the moment, ``pwd`` and ``pwn`` (print working
directory/namespace) both execute ``whoami``. At some point in the
future, ``fish`` may support the notion of a working namespace and a
``cd`` command; this is only really relevant if the user chooses to
use unix-style paths with ``fish``.
