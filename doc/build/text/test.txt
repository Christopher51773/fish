test â€” runs fish's test suite
*****************************

Runs fish's self-tests.

**FORM**

   fish test [flags] [subset to run]
   fish testcli
   fish testapi
   fish testdb

The only normally relevant flag is "-s", to run against the sandbox.

The "testcli", "testdb" and "testapi" variants run subets of the
tests.

**EXAMPLE**

   $ fish test
   ......................
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 22 tests in 47.210s

Everything is running correctly if you get a line of dots with no "E"
(error) or "F" failures.
