untag
*****

Removes one or more tags from the object or objects specified.

**FORM**

   fdb untag [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**

   fdb untag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen
   fdb untag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen
   fdb untag -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 njr/rating njr/seen
   fdb untag -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' njr/rating njr/seen
   fdb untag -U -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen

All of these commands will remove the tags ``njr/rating`` and
``njr/seen`` from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower" and ID
``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``; The last one may also tag
other objects since the query

   fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other
words and punctuation.

The ``-U`` option specifies "unix-style" relative paths; when this
option is used, tag names are assumed to be relative to the
authenticated user's namespace; if other user's tags are to be
referred to, they must be introduced with a leading ``/`` (e.g.
``/ntoll/rating). Note that ``-U`` does not affect queries specified
with ``-q``, i.e. full Fluidinfo-style paths must be used inside the
query.

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.

   $ fdb untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating
   Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
   Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTE**

The user's ability to remove tags from objects is governed by the
permissions system.
