tags â€” shows all the tags on an object with their values
********************************************************

Show the list of tags (and their values) present on an objects

**FORM**

   tags [flags] <object specifier>

**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as  user "alice":

   $ fish tags "Eiffel Tower"
   Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
   /objects/93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
     alice/seen
     fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"
     alice/rating = 7
     alice/index/about
     alice/location = "Paris"

Alternative specifications:

   tags -a "Eiffel Tower"
   tags -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
   tags -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"'

**NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS** Working from a Windows command line, single
quotes do not work as above.   Instead you need to use double quotes
and "stutter" quotes inside quotes.   So the last example becomes:

   tags -q "fluiddb/about matches """Eiffel Tower"""

All of these commands will show the names and values of all the tags
(for which the user has read permission) from the object with about
tag "Eiffel Tower" and ID "93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4"; The
last one may also show other objects since the query

   fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words "Eiffel" and "Tower", ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.
