Shell-Fish: The Online version of Fish
**************************************

[image]

A version of Fish is available online at
http://abouttag.appspot.com/fish or http://fish.abouttag.appspot.com.

This version provides full access to the whole of Fish with very few
exceptions and changes.

Key things to know are:

   * You can log into Shell-Fish, the on-line version, with any Google
     account. Shell-Fish does not see your Google password.) If you do
     this, you can go into Settings and store one or more sets of
     Fluidinfo credentials; thereafter, when you are logged in through
     your Google account, you will be able to interact with Fluidinfo
     using those credentials. (The "su" command will switch between
     users.) You can also specify whether you wish to use full
     Fluidinfo-style paths or abbreviated Unix-style paths with Fish
     online.

   * If you don't log in, you will be able to interact with Fluidinfo
     using the user called "fish". This user has restricted
     permissions, meaning that you can perform any normal read
     operations, and can tag things with tags "fish/a" through
     "fish/z", but not create new tags or namespaces, or delete tags.

   * When interacting with Shell-Fish, you use exactly commands as at
     the command line except that you may omit the "fish", i.e you can
     use

        ls

     instead of

        fish ls

     etc.

   * This help is available using the Help link at the top of the
     Shell-Fish page.

   * There is a bookmarklet called "az-fish" towards top right of the
     screen. If you drag this to your browser's tool bar and the then
     click on it when you are on an Amazon UK or Amazon US product
     page for a book, e-book, CD or MP3 track, it will take you into
     Shell-Fish and attempt to construct the appropriate about tag for
     that item using the amazon`` command anf the "abouttag" library.

   * The "Shell-Fish" service runs on Google's App Engine, which has
     limits on how long HTTP calls can take. The practical result of
     this is that complex "fish" commands may time out; for example,
     running the tests would be ill-advised. Timeouts will obviously
     be more common at times when Fluidinfo is under particularly
     heavy load.

   * If you use an iPhone or iPad, you can add the Fish page to your
     homescreen and get a "web app" version, which should show up
     looking like the one at the top of the page.
