count â€” counts the number of objects satisfying a query
*******************************************************

Counts the number of objects matching a set of conditions

**FORM**

   [fish] count [flags] <object specifier>

**EXAMPLES**

   $ fish count -q 'has njr/rating'
   141 objects matched
   Total: 141 objects

   $ fish count -a 'Eiffel Tower'
   Total: 1 object

   $ fish count -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"'
   6 objects matched
   Total: 6 objects

**NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS** Working from a Windows command line, single
quotes do not work as above.   Instead you need to use double quotes
and "stutter" quotes inside quotes.   So the last example becomes:

   fish count -q ""fluiddb/about matches ""Eiffel Tower"""

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.

   $ fish untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating
   Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
   Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTES**

The Fluidinfo API does not provide a primitive ``count`` function, so
FDB actually has to retrieve all the objects that match the query and
count them; this operation can, therefore, be comparatively slow.

The user's ability to read tags is regulated by the permissions
system, so the count reflects that, i.e. it is the restricted to
objects that the user can see the relevant tags for.
